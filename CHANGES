= 0.9.2 / 10 January 2011

 * Made the FileModel.metadata method public, to allow for custom
   metadata at the top of each page. (Wynn Netherland)

 * Relaxed the stringent dependency specifications, using pessimistic
   version constraints (see http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/16).

 * Added templates required by `nesta theme:create`.

= 0.9.1 / 31 December 2010

 * Re-implemented the default theme, using semantic HTML5 and
   Andy Clarke's Universal Internet Explorer 6 CSS. Named the previous
   default theme "slate" and moved it into a separate GitHub project.

 * Added `--git` switch to `nesta new`, that will create a new git
   repository and make an initial commit.

 * Moved the navigation helpers into the Nesta::Navigation::Renderers
   module.

= 0.9.0 / 20 December 2010

 * Packaged Nesta as a gem for the first time, instead of as a template
   site that can be cloned, edited and deployed. Added the `nesta`
   command for generating new sites and managing themes.
